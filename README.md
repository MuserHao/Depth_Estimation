# Depth_Estimation

Learning depth information from image is a crucial topic in computer vision.  It is also a problem under the general topic [Geometry learning](http://geometricdeeplearning.com/)  This project meaned to explore and build machine learning model that can output depth or relative depth from input image either in a supervised or unsupervised manner.


## Benchmark datasets
1. Indoor scene: [NYU v2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html).
2. Outdoor scene: [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth_all.php).
3. 3D model related: [Make3D](http://make3d.cs.cornell.edu/data.html).
